There's not one person on earth who I dislike more then myself. I literally just stare in the fucking mirror thinking about what a shit stain of a human being I am. Why the fuck am I like this? I'm not the same anymore. I dont know what to do anymore. I'm so fucking lost, I wish I was a blissfully ignorant kid again just fucking around in my backyard playing in the grass. I miss feeling ok about myself. I dont know who I'm looking at when I see myself in the mirror. I've lost myself, I dont know who I am anymore.

Fuck",I fucking hate myself.

Face timing and anything fun. We talked our dreams in the future and many more . I want to kill myself so much 



Her:
 I have no boyfriend.  this boy, with whom I walked a lot - I just like him and he likes me.  he is not my boyfriend and will not be my boyfriend.  but he is a very intelligent, educated and polite person.  I haven't met people like him for a long time.  I love hugging him and kissing him occasionally, but there is nothing serious between us.  and there will be nothing serious between us.  he studies in Moscow, and I  lived thousand kilometers, so in a month we will already forget each other and stop communicating.  but right now we're just having a good time.  I feel good, cozy and comfortable when I am with him.  is it bad?  If you're jealous, then okay, I won't tell you anything else about the boys I hang out with.  maybe I will offend you, but you are not the only one with whom I communicate here in this social media.  but these people come and go, and you have been here with me for almost six months, and I respect and appreciate you

Me: kisses!???

Her: kisses on the cheek, forehead, or lips
 who cares?","We met a year ago, shes from russia and im from manila, so sad , i just want to die"

What do I do when Im incompetent and i need someone to have to tell me what to do all of the time? Being incompetent makes me feel unintelligent and when someone is always having to tell me what to do all of the time I then become annoyed which later turns into anger.

Im lazy, I never want to do anything. Every thing from getting out of bed, to brushing my teeth to eating is a chore.

Im suicidal all of the time, and I have worked with a dozen different therapists to work on this issue throughout the course of three years. 

Im oblivious which has made it frustrating talking to people and has made therapy frustrating. 

Im weak physically because I dont eat, which makes me feel weak mentally.",daily struggles
